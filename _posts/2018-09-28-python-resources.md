## About
Created by Guido van Rossum Python was first released in 1991. Guido worked at Google, where he spent half of his time developing the Python language.


## Definition

An interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming:

- Interpreted is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, **without previously compiling a program** into machine-language instructions.
- High-level programming language is a programming language with **strong abstraction from the details** of the computer. In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate or even hide entirely significant areas of computing systems such as memory management. Making the process of developing a program simple.
- General-purpose means **broadly applicable across domains**. Such programming languages dosnâ€™t have specialized features for a particular domain. This is in contrast to a domain-specific language (DSL), for example R, which is specialized to Statistics and Research domain.

Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes **code readability** - the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose and operation of source code.

## Python features 

A dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including **object-oriented**, **imperative**, **functional** and **procedural**, and has a large and comprehensive standard library:

- Dynamic type checking is the process of **verifying the type** safety of a program **at runtime**. Implementations of dynamically type-checked languages generally associate each runtime object with a type tag (a reference to a type) containing its type information. 
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as **attributes**; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as **methods**. 
- Functional programming is a programming paradigm of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the **evaluation of functions and avoids changing-state (side-effects) and mutable data**.
- Imperative programming focuses on describing **how a program operates**. The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.
