It took me about **ten months to land my first job**, with no initial background in computer science whatsoever.

They were ten months of interactive [DataCamp courses (Data Scientist with Python track)](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python), YouTube videos, [Udacity free courses](https://www.udacity.com/courses/school-of-data-science) and building projects.

As it usual goes, you start with a simple linear regression equation, then you progress to classification using logistic regression and understand what a supervised learning is. You then create your first Exploratory Data Analysis workflow using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

Most of the time you copy-paste from [Kaggle’s kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels), [StackExchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/) and [StackOverflow answers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data-science), but gradually you keep adding more tasks and functionality to your projects yourself.

After a while, you decide to apply for the Junior position and probably get selected for the interview. You then get your **first Python/R assignment** and an [SQL](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/) quiz. You get rejected but you understand that it’s okay, because every time you try, you get closer to your goal of becoming a Data Scientist.
