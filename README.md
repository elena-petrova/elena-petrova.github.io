==================

## About the Site

This site is my personal home and product page. I write about stuff, I link to other stuff, I sell my guides and I showcase stuff I've done/built. It's purely personal in nature and does not necessarily reflect the views of my wonderful employer.

It lives here: [datageekette.com](http://datageekette.com)

Many of the post images are retouched versions of photos I found at [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com/). If you are looking for great photos to use on your own blog, they have a great collection all free for public use.
