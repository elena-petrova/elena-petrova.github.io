### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Elena and I do data science.

Let me tell you right away, I don't have a typical background, as one might say, for what I do. I hold a Bachelor's Degree of Economics and Management and was not involded in any Computer Science magic.

After graduating, I had no idea what I am supposed to do. So in attepts to find myself, I moved to Berlin where I live since then.

In 2016 people started buzzing about Data and Machine Learning, and so I thought to myself: "I like tech, I am interested in coding and creating new things, and I surely like the idea of analysing data. So I should give it a try!".

Even though I felt intimidated by the tech world, it still fascinated me! __So I decided to dive in and stick to it__.

After [ten intense months of absorbing online materials](https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-study-on-my-own-to-become-a-data-scientist/answer/Elena-Petrova-16?__filter__=&__nsrc__=2&__snid3__=3254244893), wrangling data at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), publishing results at [Github](https://github.com/) and of course trying not to fall into the despair. Here I am now: working in Berlin as a full-time Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer.


### Contribution
I enjoy [writing](/writing/) about stuff I learn. Occasioanylly, I speak at local conferences and meetups.
During the period 2016/2018 I was co-creating and mentoring Data Science with Python curriculums and Computer Science courses for non-profit organizations [FrauenLoop](https://www.frauenloop.org/) and [Future Legends Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/futurelegendsberlin/).
<!--Now I am writing articles and creating [self-learning guides](/#guides) for aspiring Data Professionals that have no initial background in the field.-->
