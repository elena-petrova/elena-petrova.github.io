### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Elena and I solve problems with data and code.

Let me tell you right away, that I don't have a typical background, as one might say, for what I do. I hold a Bachelor's Degree of Economics and Management and was not involded in any Computer Science magic before my graduation.

After being done with the studies, I had no idea what I am supposed to do. So in attepts to find myself, I moved to Berlin where I live since then.

In 2016 everyone were buzzing about Machine Learning and how we all live in the Data world. So I thought to myself: "I like technology, I am eager to learn how to code and create new things, and I surely like the idea of analysing things. Let's give it a try!".

I got to tell you, even though I felt intimidated by the tech world, it deeply fascinated me! __So I decided to dive in and stick to it__.

After [ten intense months of absorbing online materials](https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-study-on-my-own-to-become-a-data-scientist/answer/Elena-Petrova-16?__filter__=&__nsrc__=2&__snid3__=3254244893), wrangling data at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), publishing results at [Github](https://github.com/) and of course trying not to fall into the despair, here I am now - working in Berlin as a full-time Data Scientist and a Mentor for those who were like me, aspired and keen to learn data.


### Contribution
I enjoy [writing](/writing/) about stuff I learn. Occasioanylly, I speak at local conferences and meetups.
During the period from 2016 to 2018 I was co-creating and mentoring Data Science with Python and Computer Science courses for non-profit organizations [FrauenLoop](https://www.frauenloop.org/) and [Future Legends Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/futurelegendsberlin/). You can check their description in the [contribution](/#contribution) section.
