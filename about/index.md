### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Elena and I do machine learning at [Comtravo](https://www.comtravo.com/)

I don't have a typical background, as one might say, for what I do. I possess a Bachelor in Economics and Management from the University of Bordeaux, France.
Not long after graduating, I moved to Berlin, Germany.

In attempts of trying to find myself, I have decided to become a Data Scientist: people were keep talking about data and machine learning. And even though I was scared by this wolrd, I decided to give it a try and got hooked.
Ten intense months of absorbing online materials, wrangling data at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), publishing my data projects at [Github](https://github.com/ )and trying not to fall into despair.

And here I am. Starting my second Data Science job, after a year of valuable experience at [Auto1](https://auto1.com/). This time though as a Machine Learning Engineer as I felt more dascinated by designing solutions and engineering.

I enjoy [writing](/writing/) about things I learn. Occasioanylly, I [speak](http://github.com/jglovier/speaking) at local conferences and meetups. I also enjoy contributing to the community. During the time from 2016 to 2018 I was working with non profit organizations [FrauenLoop](https://www.frauenloop.org/) and [Future Legends Berlin(https://www.facebook.com/futurelegendsberlin/) and was creating Data Science with Python curriculums and Computer Science courses.

Now I am writing articles and creating open-source and custom [guides](/#guides) for people who want to become Data Scientists and have no initial background in the field.
